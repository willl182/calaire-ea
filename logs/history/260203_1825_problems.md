# Problem Record (Troubleshooting)

**Severity**: Low (documentation gap)
**Context**: Standardization completion session

## The Problem

After completing all 6 phases of the standardization plan and executing git commit/push, the README was not updated to reflect the changes implemented. This created a documentation gap where the repository's main entry point did not describe:

- The new journal categorization system
- The journal-daily template
- The expanded email tag system (tags_project.csv)
- The content development guidelines in AGENTS.md
- The logs/ directory structure and purpose

## Root Cause

The standardization plan (`ref/update_setup.md`) did not include README updates as a deliverable. The checklist ended with "Actualizar logs/CURRENT_SESSION.md" and did not list the README as a file requiring updates.

## The Solution / Workaround

1. Updated `README.md` with:
   - New section "Organización de Journals" with 5 categories table
   - Expanded "Templates Disponibles" including journal-daily
   - New section "Sistema de Clasificación de Correos" describing tags_project.csv
   - New section "Documentación Técnica" linking to ref/setup.md, ref/update_setup.md, AGENTS.md, ref/logseq.md
   - New section "Logs de Sesiones" describing logs/ directory purpose
   - Updated "Setup Inicial" to reference both setup.md and update_setup.md

2. Created `260203_1825_findings.md` documenting the README updates.

3. Updated plan (`ref/update_setup.md`) status to reflect README completion.

## Learning Points

1. **README as living documentation**: The README should be updated whenever structural changes to the repository are made. It's the first point of entry for anyone (including the agent) understanding the project.

2. **Plan completeness**: Future plans should explicitly list all documentation artifacts that need updating, not just the core technical files. The README is a critical artifact.

3. **Validation checklist**: After completing a plan, verify:
   - [ ] Core files modified/created
   - [ ] README reflects current state
   - [ ] Log files updated (findings, problems)
   - [ ] Session state updated

4. **User feedback loop**: The user correctly identified the omission ("se nos olvidó el readme"), highlighting the importance of having the user review deliverables before finalizing.

## Status

Resolved. README updated and git commit/push pending.
