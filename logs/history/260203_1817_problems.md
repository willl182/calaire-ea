# Learning Points / Process Insights

**Context**: Implementación del plan de estandarización de journals y tags

## Observations and Learnings

1. **Alignment between email classification and knowledge graph**
   - Initial state: `docs/tags_project.csv` had 15 tags with no explicit connection to Logseq structure
   - Realization: Without a mapping column, there was risk of duplication or gaps between email taxonomy and journal categories
   - Solution: Added `Categoria_Journal` column to create explicit correspondence
   - Learning: External communication systems (email) should mirror internal knowledge structure for traceability

2. **Journal consistency across the graph**
   - Initial state: 6 journals with different structures (some well-organized, others minimal)
   - Realization: Without standards, the graph becomes fragmented and hard to query
   - Solution: Defined 5 standard categories and homogenized all existing journals
   - Learning: Establish standards early, then apply retroactively. The standard categories cover all operational areas of CALAIRE-EA.

3. **Content development vs. literal transcription**
   - Initial pattern: User provides quick notes; agent copies verbatim
   - Realization: This creates "raw notes" not suitable for technical documentation
   - Solution: Created explicit guidelines in AGENTS.md with examples of transformation
   - Learning: The agent's role is to enrich and contextualize, not transcribe. User input = brief notes; agent output = technical documentation.

4. **Historical content handling**
   - Challenge: Old journals contain outdated diagrams (Gantt/Timeline from March 2026, now reprogrammed)
   - Decision: Don't delete—mark as historical and collapse
   - Learning: Preserve historical context but distinguish from current state. Use tags `#version-historica` and `#nota-historica` appropriately.

## No Blocking Issues

This session completed all 6 phases of the standardization plan without blocking issues. The SSH key problem documented in previous session (`260203_0030_problems.md`) was already resolved.

## Process Insights

- The plan-first approach (creating `ref/update_setup.md` before execution) allowed for clear tracking and validation
- Batch updating journals (all 6 files in one session) ensures consistency
- Adding mapeo (mapping) columns to CSVs creates explicit traceability between systems
