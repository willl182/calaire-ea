# Problems: TODOs Location Clarification

**Date**: 2026-02-03 19:15
**Context**: Update 2 to ref/setup.md - clarifying location of TODOs and decisions in journals

---

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Ambiguity in Setup Documentation

**Severity**: Low - Process Improvement
**Description**: The original setup documentation (`ref/setup.md`) did not have explicit instructions about where to place TODOs and decisions in daily journals.

**Evidence**:
- Section "Operaciones Básicas" said: "Nueva Tarea: Crear bloque en Journal → `TODO Tarea... project:: [[CALAIRE-EA]]`"
- No mention of whether tasks should be inside categories or loose at the end
- Template `journal-daily` created category structure but didn't show where TODOs belong

**Impact**:
- User created `2026_02_02.md` with 4 loose blocks at the end
- Unclear pattern for future journal entries
- Inconsistent structure possible across journals

**Resolution**:
- Added explicit section "Ubicación de TODOs y Decisiones" to ref/setup.md
- Clarified that TODOs/#decision go inside thematic categories
- Created reference table showing location rules

**Learning**:
- Setup documentation must cover all block types (narrative, TODO, decision)
- When adding features (categories), consider where existing block types should go
- Use concrete examples and tables for clarity

### 2. Content Block Ambiguity (Non-TODO)

**Severity**: Low - Process Improvement
**Description**: In `2026_01_30.md`, there were content blocks (not TODOs) loose at the end:
- `#[[Reunión: Coordinación Operativa]]` with Fabian Moreno availability
- `[[CALAIRE-APP]]` with github, repo, Python2 notes

**Evidence**:
- Lines 100-105 in original file
- Neither were TODO/DOING/DONE/#decision
- Both were content blocks without clear category

**Decision Made**:
- Meeting moved under `## Gestión Administrativa` (administrative coordination)
- CALAIRE-APP moved under `## Desarrollo Técnico` (technical details about app repo)

**Impact**:
- Content blocks also need thematic categorization
- Meeting references can be categorized by domain
- Technical notes should go under technical categories

**Learning**:
- Guidelines should apply to ALL blocks, not just TODOs
- Meeting references can be categorized by content domain
- Need to distinguish between: standalone meeting pages vs. meeting references in journals

## Non-Issues (Clarified During Review)

### 1. DOING Inside Meeting Pages

**Initial Concern**: In `2026_01_28.md`, there's a `DOING` block inside a meeting structure.

**Analysis**:
- This is correct: meeting pages have their own template structure
- The DOING is inside `#[[Reunión: Aplicativo CALAIRE-APP]]` which follows template `reunion`
- Template `reunion` has an "Acciones" section for TODOs

**Conclusion**: Not an issue. Different structure for standalone meeting pages vs. journal daily entries.

---

### 2. Historical Notes Structure

**Initial Concern**: `2026_01_12.md` and `2026_01_11.md` only have `#nota-historica`, no categories.

**Analysis**:
- This is by design per ref/setup.md:
  > "Journals con contenido mínimo (2 líneas o menos): marcar como `- #nota-historica`."
- Historical notes don't require categories
- They are marked to avoid confusion with active content

**Conclusion**: Not an issue. Design pattern for minimal historical entries.

---

## No Critical Errors

**Summary**: No blocking or critical errors encountered during this update.

All issues were:
- Process improvements (setup documentation completeness)
- Pattern clarifications (content block categorization)
- Design pattern confirmations (meetings, historical notes)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Comprehensive Setup Documentation**: When adding new structures (categories), consider all block types that will interact with them.

2. **Content Block Categorization**: Extend guidelines to cover ALL blocks, not just TODOs/decisions.

3. **Distinguish Context Types**:
   - Journal daily entries: all blocks under categories
   - Meeting pages: blocks inside meeting template structure
   - Historical notes: no categories required

4. **Use Tables for Reference**: The decision table in `ref/setup.md` was effective for clarity.

## Process Quality

**Strengths**:
- User identified ambiguity proactively
- Comprehensive audit of all journals (6 files)
- Systematic approach: plan → document → implement → verify

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Setup documentation review should happen after major structural changes
- Consider creating templates that show TODO placement explicitly
