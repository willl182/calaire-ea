### Comprehensive Project Governance Guide: Crafting the Project Charter and Stakeholder Registry for the CALAIRE-EA Initiative

#### 1\. The Strategic Framework for Value Delivery

In accordance with the  *PMBOK® Guide Seventh Edition* , the Project Charter and Stakeholder Registry for the CALAIRE-EA project (Project 61134\) are not merely administrative formalities; they are the bedrock of a  **System for Value Delivery** . This system represents a shift from governing simple outputs to focusing on a value chain that advances organizational strategy. For this initiative, value is not merely the completion of a report, but the establishment of  **National Metrological Sovereignty** —ensuring Colombia possesses the permanent capability to monitor criteria gases (CO, NOx, SO2, O3) through validated Proficiency Testing (EA) and Inter-laboratory Comparison (CIL).The "Value Delivery System" for CALAIRE-EA functions through a rigorous  **Information Flow** . Strategic objectives move from the Instituto Nacional de Metrología (INM) leadership down through the project team, while operational performance data from the CALAIRE-APP statistical engine flows back to senior leadership to inform policy. Project 61134 creates value through:

* **Service Permanence:**  Establishing the first sustainable EA/CIL service for air quality in Colombia, moving beyond temporary pilot cycles.  
* **Regulatory Alignment:**  Achieving compliance with ISO 17043 and ISO 13528:2022 standards to enable international recognition of Colombian laboratory data.  
* **Technical Asset Growth:**  Delivering the CALAIRE-APP software as a permanent intellectual property asset for the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL).By adopting a principles-based approach, the CALAIRE-EA team is empowered to focus on  **outcomes** —specifically the long-term reliability of national air monitoring—rather than just the production of documentary protocols. This strategic alignment ensures that every project action is a step toward institutionalized quality.

#### 2\. Architecture of the CALAIRE-EA Project Charter

The Project Charter serves as the primary authorizing document, bridging the institutional "Business Need" with "Project Execution." It formalizes the authority of the Project Director to utilize UNAL and INM resources to meet the strategic requirement for a permanent Ozone Designated Institute.

##### Project Justification & Business Case

The project addresses the critical gap in Colombia’s air quality infrastructure by investing  **$437,660,356 COP**  to implement permanent Proficiency Testing. This business case is built on the necessity of high-precision metrology for environmental health. The project ensures that laboratories monitoring CO, NOx, SO2, and O3 operate with traceable accuracy, thereby protecting the public and meeting legislative mandates.

##### High-Level Objectives & Success Criteria

The objective is the successful deployment of a QMS-integrated EA service. Success is defined by the validation of the CALAIRE-APP (ISO 13528:2022 compliance) and the execution of the 2026 pilot phase. Notably, the pilot schedule includes  **8 planned rounds (with 2 canceled)** , establishing a constraint for the initial baseline evaluation of participant competency.

##### Milestone Schedule

While the initial project timeline was set for Nov 2025, a formal extension has been granted through late 2026 to ensure the transition from "Pilot execution" to full "Service Portfolio Integration."| Phase | Milestone Description | Deadline / Status || \------ | \------ | \------ || **Phase I: Design** | Research, preliminary protocols, and ISO 17043/13528 training. | **Completed** || **Phase II: Execution & Pilot** | Equipment setup and pilot testing (Mar 18 – May 4, 2026). | **In Progress** || **Phase III: QMS & Launch** | SGC integration, costing, and service dissemination. | **Nov 2026** |

##### Resource Allocation & Team Functions

The project maps specific technical roles to the functional domains of project management to ensure accountability and expertise.| Team Member | Project Role | PMBOK® Functional Mapping || \------ | \------ | \------ || **Carmen Elena Zapata** | Project Director | **Provide Oversight & Coordination:**  Goal alignment and senior-level supervision. || **Technical Leader** | Operations Expert | **Perform Work & Contribute Insights:**  Subject matter expertise in air quality sensors. || **Jeniffer Ochoa** | QMS Specialist | **Apply Expertise:**  Maintaining ISO 17025/17043 documentary integrity. || **David Esteban Pulgarín** | Costing Specialist | **Provide Business Direction:**  Developing the economic model for service sustainability. || **César Yate** | ISO 17043 Consultant | **Facilitate & Support:**  Technical validation and external audit readiness. |

**The "So What?" Layer:**  The charter explicitly includes a  **"No Subcontracting" Declaration** . This mandate is a critical risk control; by performing all EA activities internally, the project prevents the dilution of technical expertise and ensures that the core value—national metrological capability—remains an internal organizational asset rather than a transient external service.

#### 3\. The Stakeholder Registry: Identification and Influence Analysis

The Stakeholder Performance Domain is vital because projects are "performed by people and for people." For CALAIRE-EA, the engagement strategy must distinguish between "millions" of beneficiaries (the general public) and the "small groups" of laboratory participants whose technical cooperation is mandatory for success.

##### Stakeholder Registry Table

Stakeholder Name,Internal/External,Power/Influence,Core Interest

INM (National Metrology Inst.),External (Partner),High,Strategic sovereignty and national standards.

UNAL (CALAIRE),Internal,High,Operational excellence and permanent service.

Univ. de Medellín (UMed),External,Medium,Competency testing (Rounds 3 & 4).

Univ. Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB),External,Medium,Competency testing (Round 5).

SIATA,External,Medium,"Pending Confirmation  (Deadline Feb 15, 2026)."

Regulatory Bodies (ISO/Accred.),External,High,Compliance with ISO 17043/13528.

##### Engagement Strategy: Interactive Communication

For the confirmed laboratories (UMed, UPB) and the pending SIATA, the strategy is  **Interactive Communication** . Engagement is centered on the pilot test window (March-May 2026):

* **Product Demos:**  Walkthroughs of the CALAIRE-APP Python 3 interface to ensure correct data entry.  
* **Iteration Reviews:**  Rapid feedback loops post-round to adjust protocols for CO, NOx, SO2, and O3 before the Nov 2026 launch.**The "So What?" Layer:**  The  **Regulatory Environment (ISO 17043/13528)**  functions as a non-human stakeholder. This environment dictates the dimensions of "Quality" and "Conformity." It is an active constraint that forces the project to prioritize statistical irrefutability in the CALAIRE-APP over mere ease of use, as compliance is the primary "gatekeeper" for project success.

#### 4\. Integration of Quality and Risk into Governance Artifacts

The quality principle focuses on "fitness for use." In metrology, this means the  **CALAIRE-APP**  must not only work but produce results that are mathematically sound under the rigorous ISO 13528:2022 framework.

##### Acceptance Criteria for Key Deliverables

Deliverable,Acceptance Criteria

CALAIRE-APP,"Validated nIQR, MADe, and Robust Algorithm A calculations with zero logic errors."

Portafolio de Servicios,Formalized EA/CIL pricing and logistics integrated into UNAL operations.

Manual de Transporte,Evidence of zero calibration loss during movement of critical instruments.

##### Risk Optimization: Threats vs. Opportunities

* **Threats:**  Critical gaps in ISO 17043 Chapter 7 (Statistical Design) and Chapter 8 (Data Management) could disqualify the institute from accreditation.  
* **Opportunities:**  The automation of ISO 13528 calculations via Python 3 presents an opportunity to eliminate the  **manual verification errors**  identified in early project reviews.

##### Critical Backlog: Wave 1 Documentary Readiness (P1 Priorities)

These 10 documents are the mandatory prerequisites for the upcoming ISO 17043 audit. They represent 52 hours of critical path effort:

1. **P-PSEA-01:**  General EA Protocol  
2. **P-PSEA-02:**  NO-NO2 Procedure  
3. **P-PSEA-03:**  CO Procedure  
4. **P-PSEA-04:**  O3 Procedure  
5. **P-PSEA-05:**  SO2 Procedure  
6. **P-PSEA-06:**  Statistical Design  
7. **P-PSEA-07:**  Results Report  
8. **P-PSEA-09:**  Round Planning  
9. **DG Quality Policy:**  General Manuals  
10. **Evidence Formats (F):**  Registration and Evidence Logs**The "So What?" Layer:**  The principle of  **Stewardship**  (Integrity and Honesty) was recently exemplified through the team's transparency regarding a "validation error." The team successfully identified that the discrepancy was a  **manual verification error**  and not a failure of the CALAIRE-APP software. By honestly reporting human calculation failures, the team protects the integrity of the automated system, demonstrating a commitment to metrological truth.

#### 5\. Conclusion and Tailoring Guidance

The CALAIRE-EA project requires  **Context-Based Tailoring** . We must blend the  **predictive**  requirements of international ISO audits with the  **adaptive**  development of the CALAIRE-APP software. A rigid approach would fail the software's need for iteration, while an overly agile approach would fail the audit.

##### Project Director’s Governance Checklist

To maintain alignment with the  **PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct**  throughout the 20-month (extended) duration:

*   **Responsibility:**  Is the "No Subcontracting" rule being strictly enforced to build internal capacity?  
*   **Respect:**  Is the SIATA "pending" status being resolved before the Feb 15 deadline to respect their operational window?  
*   **Fairness:**  Are the robust statistical methods (nIQR/MADe) applied uniformly to all participating laboratories?  
*   **Honesty:**  Are all manual verification discrepancies recorded transparently to maintain the "Stewardship" of the statistical engine?By treating these governance artifacts as living documents, the CALAIRE-EA initiative will successfully transition from a temporary project to a permanent pillar of Colombian environmental quality.
