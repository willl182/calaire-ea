### Technical Project Roadmap: Implementing Proficiency Testing for Criteria Pollutant Gases

#### 1\. Foundational Project Vision and Strategic Objectives

The establishment of an independent Proficiency Testing (EA) and Interlaboratory Comparison (CIL) service in Colombia is a strategic imperative to bridge the critical compliance gap currently facing air quality laboratories. Under ISO/IEC 17025:2017 (Requirement 7.7.2), laboratories must ensure the validity of their results by participating in external performance evaluations. However, the national infrastructure currently lacks a competent, impartial, and independent body to provide these services for criteria gases. Project 61134, a collaboration between the Instituto Nacional de Metrología (INM) and the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL), addresses this deficit by transitioning the CALAIRE laboratory—already the Designated Institute (ID) for tropospheric Ozone (O3) quantity of substance per Resolution 263 of 2023—into a permanent metrological service provider.This initiative is backed by a total investment of  **$437,660,356** , comprising a $299,500,000 agreement between UNAL and INM, and a $101,849,700 in-kind contribution from the Facultad de Minas \- Medellín. The project’s transition from theoretical research to a permanent service is guided by the following primary objectives:

* **Global Best Practice Identification:**  Synthesizing international benchmarks for CIL/EA development through rigorous state-of-the-art literature reviews.  
* **Metrological Protocol Engineering:**  Developing standardized technical procedures for the measurement of the four primary criteria pollutant gases.  
* **Statistical Application Design:**  Defining robust data comparison methodologies and architecting free-access software tools for objective performance scoring.  
* **Pilot Validation:**  Executing internal "proof of concept" trials at CALAIRE to refine and harden technical protocols.  
* **QMS Integration:**  Incorporating new services into the existing Laboratory Management System to satisfy ISO 17043 requirements.  
* **Economic Sustainability:**  Establishing a rigorous cost-pricing framework to ensure long-term operational viability.

##### Regulatory Framework

The execution of this project is governed by the following international standards, ensuring the technical competence of the provider and the reliability of the performance evaluations:| Standard | Title | Application to Technical Execution || \------ | \------ | \------ || **ISO 17043:2023** | General requirements for proficiency testing | Defines the structural and technical requirements for the competence, impartiality, and consistency of the PT provider. || **ISO 13528:2017** | Statistical methods for use in proficiency testing | Provides the mathematical framework for performance evaluation, including the determination of assigned values and their uncertainty. || **ISO/IEC 17025:2017** | General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories | Serves as the fundamental benchmark for participant laboratories and the core of CALAIRE's existing accreditation. |

These objectives and standards dictate the metrological parameters required to transform CALAIRE into a unique service provider for Latin America.

#### 2\. Metrological Scope and Technical Parameters

The technical scope of the project focuses on the four foundational criteria pollutant gases:  **Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Ozone (O3)** . These gases represent the core of the national air quality monitoring network. Notably, as the  **Designated Institute (ID) for Ozone**  under Resolution 263 of 2023, CALAIRE possesses the unique metrological authority to lead this initiative. Upon implementation, CALAIRE will be the  **sole provider**  of these specialized proficiency testing services in Colombia and the broader Latin American region, eliminating the current dependence on international providers.

##### Technical Methodology and Global Interoperability

The project adopts measurement methods established by the  **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**  and the  **European Union** . This choice is critical for regional interoperability; by aligning with these global benchmarks, the project ensures that data generated by Colombian laboratories can be integrated into global atmospheric and health models without conversion bias.

##### Scalability and Future Roadmap

The architecture of this project is designed for modular expansion. While the current focus is on gaseous pollutants, the roadmap includes future integration of:

* Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5)  
* Black CarbonThe transition to these parameters is simplified by the robust QMS and statistical framework established in this primary phase.

#### 3\. Phase-Based Execution Timeline and Technical Milestones

Maintaining metrological integrity requires a staged 20-month execution cycle, allowing for the stabilization of analyzers and the validation of statistical software before service dissemination.

#### 4\. Technical Leadership: Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities

The  **Contratista No Egresado: Líder de Proyecto EC/Experto en Calidad de Aire**  serves as the project's central nervous system, holding total responsibility for technical operations and metrological precision.

##### Mandate and Technical Impact

The Technical Lead’s role goes beyond mere coordination; they are responsible for:

* **Codifying Metrological Traceability:**  Defining the chain of comparisons to international standards to ensure all PT results are legally and scientifically defensible.  
* **Architecting Uncertainty Models:**  Determining specific uncertainty models for assigned values, ensuring they account for the  **homogeneity and stability**  of gas mixtures as required by ISO 13528\.  
* **Defining Acceptance Criteria:**  Establishing the technical thresholds for measurement competence.  
* **Technical Supervision:**  Overseeing the performance of the Air Quality Engineer and undergraduate students, ensuring that field activities match the rigor of the written protocols.

##### Collaborative Ecosystem

The Lead interacts within a specialized structure to ensure project alignment:

* **Project Director (Carmen Elena Zapata):**  Overall supervision and document approval.  
* **QMS Specialist (Jeniffer Ochoa):**  Synchronizing technical protocols with ISO 17025 and 17043 compliance.  
* **Costing Specialist (David Esteban Pulgarín):**  Transforming technical requirements into a sustainable economic pricing model.  
* **REDAIRE-UNAL:**  Leveraging university research expertise for regional impact.

#### 5\. Methodological Design and Statistical Framework

The validity of a Proficiency Testing round depends entirely on statistical rigor. Without objective evaluation, performance scores lack the impartiality required for ISO 17043 compliance.

##### Statistical Application and Data Validity

The project includes the development of a free software application specifically for ISO 13528-compliant data analysis. The Technical Lead acts as the "final user," subjecting the software to rigorous testing to ensure it correctly calculates z-scores and other performance indicators. This ensures that the mathematical outputs correctly reflect the laboratories' true measurement competence.

##### Protocol Development Criteria

Individual procedures for each gas focus on the practical realities of air quality monitoring:

* **Field Installation and Stabilization:**  Precise requirements to prevent environmental interference.  
* **Field Verification:**  Methods for "in-situ" checks during the comparison round.  
* **Data Integrity:**  Use of standardized  **bitácoras**  (logs) to ensure all environmental variables are recorded for future uncertainty analysis.

#### 6\. Pilot Implementation and Operational Execution

The internal pilot test at the CALAIRE laboratory is the definitive "proof of concept." This phase tests the resilience of the protocols under field conditions.

##### Execution Workflow

1. **Analyzer Preparation:**  Technical "puesta a punto" to ensure instruments meet sensitivity and stability thresholds.  
2. **Measurement Execution:**  Rigorous application of the draft gas protocols.  
3. **Data Documentation:**  Capture of all technical events in formal laboratory registers and the project bitácora.  
4. **Corrective Actions:**  Implementation of immediate controls for any identified deviations during the trial.

##### Data Transformation

The raw data from this pilot is synthesized into an  **Internal Pilot Test Report** . This document is the primary feedback mechanism used to finalize the gas protocols and refine the statistical software, ensuring the service is robust enough for national and regional participants.

#### 7\. QMS Integration and Technical Risk Mitigation

Strategic integration with the Laboratory Quality Management System (QMS) is required to meet the 2027 accreditation target. All technical documents must be processed through the  **F-GCM-03 Document Request**  form, ensuring they are controlled and integrated into the laboratory's institutional memory.

##### Technical Risk Assessment and "So What?" Analysis

The project manages three primary technical risks that could undermine the service's integrity:

* **Timeline Delays:**  Delays in protocol finalization postpone the research cycle, potentially missing critical funding windows.  
* **Equipment Failure:**  Malfunctioning analyzers during a PT round prevent the laboratory from meeting  **ISO 13528 requirements for stable assigned values** , effectively invalidating the entire comparison round. Redundancy and "puesta a punto" protocols are the primary mitigations.  
* **Personnel Scarcity:**  The scarcity of air quality metrologists in the market is mitigated by the Lead's mandate to provide continuous training and standardized instructions (F-GCM-03) to the support team.

##### Concluding Summary

Through the leadership of the Technical Lead and the strategic backing of UNAL and INM, this project establishes a foundational metrological service that currently does not exist in Latin America. By providing a competent and impartial mechanism for proficiency testing, the CALAIRE laboratory significantly strengthens Colombia’s national quality infrastructure, ensuring that environmental decisions are based on the most reliable air quality data available.
